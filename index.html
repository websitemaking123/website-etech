        <b>GUADAYO Engineering Firm</b> is an engineering and manufacturing company within the energy, industrial, and scientific market segments. With more than 70 years of expertise in delivering engineered solutions to our global customer base, we are known for product quality as well as engineering versatility and creativity. 
        A company dealing with electro- mechanical works and has been involved in welding; electrical works; fabrication; installation of mechanical and electrical equipment; and air brake systems. 
        We also specialize in the design of customized vessels and piping assemblies used in a variety of temperature and pressure ranges, which includes cryogenic applications. Furthermore, as a fully certified ASME Code Section VIII Division 1 facility, we have only ASME certified welders. In addition to providing quality 
        product and workmanship throughout the process, GEF includes a full document package with each shipment. A sample of GEF’s document package structure can be provided upon request.
        The majority of our solutions are used throughout the liquid-gas supply chain for the purification, liquefaction, distribution, storage and end use of gases and hydrocarbons. This includes cryogenic transfer, storage, and processing such as vacuum insulated piping, dewars, valve boxes and expansion cans.
        In addition to vessels and cryogenic equipment, we design and manufacture precision-machined and water-jet cut parts.
